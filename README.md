## ðŸª§ About me
- I have been developing since I was 15, on LUA/GLUA with 4 GMOD servers, one of which is the best French server in its category.
- I stopped dev on Gmod 2 years ago. I founded a large community with +10,000 unique players.
- I would like to work in the video game in order to lead a dev team in order to be able to create my projects
